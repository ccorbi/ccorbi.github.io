## Research

A biologic is a product that is produced from living organisms or contains components of living organisms with therapeutic activity. Commonly are part or complete proteins.  Biologics are safer, with a broader range of targets, higher specificity,  and allow more complex strategies than conventional small molecules.  Currently, I am a senior Postdoc at [Prof. Philip M Kim's Lab](http://www.kimlab.org) conducting research focused on the integration of data from multiple high-throughput experiments to design biologics with therapeutic activity. I apply techniques ranging from modern machine learning and computational structural biology to preprocess and analyze data from yeast-two hybrid, bacteria-two hybrid and pooled lentiviral screens. 

During my Ph.D., I studied the conformational equilibrium of proteins using molecular dynamics and free energy calculations. Besides, I performed part of the experiments to validate my computational predictions.  Moreover, I have experience in biophysical techniques for the characterization of protein-protein interactions such as calorimetry and spectroscopy.

Working for Almirall laboratories as a Scientific Data Manager, I collaborated with different teams and departments across multiple disciplines to successfully design, develop and implement the protocols for preprocessing and digital storage of the experimental data of the drug discovery pipeline.
