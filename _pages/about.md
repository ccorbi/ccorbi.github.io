## Data-driven Research


We are living in an era of paradigm reinvention peace with no precedent.  This acceleration creates new opportunities and new challenges. An urgent challenge brought by recent technological advances is tackling the unprecedented scale and high dimensionality of the data. This affects many fields, from science to marketing.  Consequently,   a multidisciplinary background and flexible are attitudes a must-have skill to respond to this rapid chain of changes and successfully extract valuable knowledge from the flood of data available.

Currently, I am a senior Postdoc at [Prof. Philip M Kim's Lab](http://www.kimlab.org) conducting research focused on the integration of data from multiple high throughput experiments applying statistical and advanced computational tools in order to develop biologics with therapeutic activity. Biologics are safer, with a wider range of targets, and allow more complex strategies than conventional drugs. Consequently, biologics represent a new generation for the pharmaceutical industry and arguably one of the grounds for personalized medicine and Data-driven treatment.
