Experience
======


* **Postdoctoral fellow @ University of Toronto.**
  *( Toronto, CANADA ) April 2014 â€“ Present (5 years)*
  
    *	I created tools and methods for data processing and analysis of high-throughput experiments.
    *	I designed pipelines for collection of biological data from heterogenic sources; databases, physicochemical calculations and    predictions of machine learning models.    
    *	Analytics of high-throughput experiments using a wide range of analytical techniques; supervised, clustering, network analysis and data visualization.
      *	I work in the implementation of deep learning for precise classification of cancer patients using multi-OMICS data. 
      *	I work to build model for prediction of pathological impact of mutation.
      *	I work to predict binding of protein to DNA sequences.  
      
    *	I mentored undergrad, and grad students.    
    *	I co-administer the IT infrastructure of the lab. 


* **PhD student, Research Assistant @ University of Granada. Biophysics Department.**
  *( Granada, SPAIN ) September 2007 - December 2013 (5 years )*
  
    *	I conducted a novel analysis of the allosteric and cooperative effects on proteins using state-of-the-art large-scale full-atom computational simulations.
    *	I designed a pipeline for preprocessing and analysis of water molecules in structures of peptide domain recognition domains. 
    *	I performed protein expression and biophysical experiments. 


*	**Scientific Data Manager @ Almirall Pharma. Information department.**
  *( Barcelona, SPAIN ) January 2005 - August 2007 (2 year)*
  
    *	I designed and implemented protocols for preprocessing and digital storage of the experimental data of the drug discovery pipeline.
