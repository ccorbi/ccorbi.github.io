### Summary 

With over 15 years of experience in computational biology, drug discovery, and data science, I specialize in utilizing advanced computational methodologies to drive innovation in biological research. My expertise spans high-performance computing, molecular simulations, and biophysics, enabling me to decode complex biological systems and accelerate drug discovery efforts. Additionally, I excel in deploying big data applications and leveraging machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from large datasets.


Education
======
* B.Sc. Molecular Biology, Universitat de Girona, 2003
* M.Sc. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 2004
* Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, Universidad de Granada, 2012.

Experience
======
* **Senior ML Engineer II @  Recursion Pharmaceuticals**
  *( Toronto, CANADA ) August 2025 – Present*

  * Advanced Data Processing & Orchestration: Drove the data ingestion and standardization process for a large-scale ML platform. Architected an automated system to version and manage different data processing protocols for various assays, directly impacting model accuracy and reliability.
 
  * Applieng agentic solutions to streamline workflows and automate complex decision-making and information retrival processes, significantly reducing toil in drug discovery

* **Senior Data Scientist @ Recursion Pharmaceuticals**
  *( Toronto, CANADA ) April 2023 – July 2025*

  * Automated Hit-to-lead pipeline. Built a comprehensive, automated platform to guide compound selection through multiple decision stages. This platform used a combination of machine learning, property calculations, and proprietary tools to make data-driven decisions and maximize the success rate of compounds.

  * Predictive Modeling: Developed robust predictive models for cytotoxicity and potency, providing crucial insights for compound selection and optimization within the drug discovery process. 

* **Computational Scientist @ Cyclica**
  *( Toronto, CANADA ) April 2020 – April 2023 (3 years)*

  * High-Throughput Screening: Developed an advanced pipeline for hit identification, leveraging multiple machine learning models to predict drug-target interactions and drug-like properties. This pipeline utilized Google Cloud Compute to screen up to 36 billion compounds at scale, identifying novel hits efficiently 

  * Compound Generation Engine: Created a robust engine for generating novel compounds using Enamine's synthetic chemistry building blocks. This served as the foundation for a genetic algorithm that explored combinatorial chemical space, enabling the discovery of new drug candidates.
