Computational biologist with 10 years of research experience within multidisciplinary teams. Proficient in researching, design and implementing full stack data analysis workflow. Significant experience as liaison, project management and implementing functional requirements.


Education
======
* B.Sc. Molecular Biology, Universitat de Girona, 2003
* M.Sc. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 2004
* Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, Universidad de Granada, 2012.

Experience
======
* Postdoctoral fellow @ University of Toronto. 
  ( Toronto, CANADA ) April 2014 – Present (5 years)
    o	I created tools and methods for data processing and analysis of high-throughput experiments.
    o	I designed pipelines for collection of biological data from heterogenic sources; databases, physicochemical calculations and    predictions of machine learning models.
    o	Analytics of high-throughput experiments using a wide range of analytical techniques; supervised, clustering, network analysis and data visualization.  
      -	I work in the implementation of deep learning for precise classification of cancer patients using multi-OMICS data. 
      -	I work to build model for prediction of pathological impact of mutation.
      -	I work to predict binding of protein to DNA sequences.  
    o	I mentored undergrad, and grad students.
  o	I co-administer the IT infrastructure of the lab. 

* PhD student, Research Assistant @ University of Granada. Biophysics Department. 
  ( Granada, SPAIN ) September 2007 - December 2013 (5 years )
    o	I conducted a novel analysis of the allosteric and cooperative effects on proteins using state-of-the-art large-scale full-atom computational simulations.
    o	I designed a pipeline for preprocessing and analysis of water molecules in structures of peptide domain recognition domains. 
    o	I performed protein expression and biophysical experiments. 

*	Scientific Data Manager @ Almirall Pharma. Information department.
  ( Barcelona, SPAIN ) January 2005 - August 2007 (2 year)
    o	I designed and implemented protocols for preprocessing and digital storage of the experimental data of the drug discovery pipeline.
